# Tic-Tac-Toe
Hello world!

After finishing my first python course, I decided to challenge myself with a tic-tac-toe project!

I hope with the time and following up my development, I will be able to improve this code and also develop an AI version
which will allow the person to play against the computer.

My will was to create a tic tac toe which you can choose how many times you would like to play (All-in, Best of 3,
Best of 5, and so on...)

There is also a portuguese version "Jogo do Galo"

Have fun with a collegue!

Any suggestions about this code and/or new projects, please feel free to comment
